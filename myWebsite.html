                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am an energetic and passionate second year computer science student working towards a Bachelor in Computer Science
                        at Babeș-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca and searching for an internship. Enjoy problem solving and technology. 
                        I would like to put my skills and knowledge in real-life projects and I am always open for learning new things.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Satu Mare on the 3rd of March 2003 and I grew up and lived in a village near it until I came to univeristy. 
                        In highschool I went to Ioan Slavici National College, Satu Mare where I studied mathematics and computer science
                        and I graduated in 2022 with 9.41 at the baccalaureate. When I was younger, before I met computer science in highschool, 
                        I liked math and my dream was to become a math teacher because I like children also. But then I realized that my dream job 
                        would be a programmer and now I'm on my way to fulfill that dream. I never was a perfect sudent because that does't exist,
                        I wnated to be like that, to tend to that and maybe some people saw me somehow like that, but I tried my best.</p>
                    <p>About my passions, besides programming, I like reading books, those are relaxing me and help to escape a little bit
                        reality when needed. I enjoy reading fantasy books, romance and personal growth. I like art, especially drawing and 
                        music, I like singing and that's why I took part of the choir at the church I used to go to when I was at home.</p>
                    <p>So I think I can say that I am a creative person, I always try to be puctual, I hate being late, I like working with people
                        and helping them if I can. During highschool, before the pandemic I was volunteering at an orphanage where I was helping
                        children with their homework.</p>
